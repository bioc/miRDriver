The datasets included are included to give the user an idea of the type of data that is required to run the pipeline. This includes genomic data (gene expression, copy number variation, transcription factor) and epigenomic data (methylation). The gene expression data can be RNASeq or Microarray data with proper  normalization, althought the code has not been tested on Microarray data. The first phase of miRDriver requires copy number data files that are segmented. The Lasso phase of miRDriver requires gene centric copy number data. The methylation data needs to be gene centric beta values. For further details on how to preprocess the datasets, one should reference the method paper  "miRDriver: A tool to infer copy number derived miRNA-Gene networks in cancer". The data sets included in this package are dummy datasets that are used to run the code in the vignette, but are not large enough to produce meaningful results. The original data that the dummy datasets are derived from are included on our github page. Our original data sets are from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database. For actual datasets one can use the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database or any other resource. When  preparing the dummy data sets we chose 10 patients, and cropped each dataset to only include the 10 chosen patients. We also reduced the number of genes and only included the genes that were a part of the chosen group.
